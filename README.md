# In This I have created an app using vue-native.

After cloning the project

# Run command 
yarn add expo

# Go to folder directory
cd <projectName>

# Start Server
yarn start

This command wil open a window, where on left bottom there is a QR code.

# For android
For scanning that QR code install expo app from playstore. After scanning you can see your app in your mobile.
